# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

MacUsage — a macOS menu bar system monitor (iStat Menus-inspired) written in Swift/SwiftUI. Plain Swift Package Manager executable, no Xcode project, no dependencies, macOS 13+.

## Commands

```bash
swift build -c release          # build (no tests exist)
./install.sh                    # the dev loop: build → assemble .app → install to /Applications → relaunch
./install.sh 2>&1 | grep -E "error|✓"   # quieter variant
```

- `install.sh` generates the Info.plist, ad-hoc codesigns, and pkills the old instance. The bundle version string lives in `install.sh`, not in any plist in the repo.
- To try a build **without** replacing the installed app: `swift build -c release && .build/release/MacUsage &` (second gauge icon appears); kill with `pkill -f '.build/release/MacUsage'`.
- `open` occasionally fails with LaunchServices error -600 right after a rapid kill/replace — just retry it.
- End users install via `curl -fsSL .../bootstrap.sh | bash` (clones to a temp dir, runs install.sh) and remove via `uninstall.sh`. Installer prompts read from `/dev/tty`, not stdin — stdin carries the piped script.
- Convention in this repo: Claude commits, the user pushes.

## Architecture

Data flows one way: **Readers → StatsStore → SwiftUI views**.

- `Readers/*.swift` — one class per data source, each returning plain structs from `Models/StatModels.swift`. To add a stat: new reader, new model struct, a `@Published` property + call in `StatsStore.refreshAllStats()`, a card in `StatsPanelView`.
- `StatsStore` (@MainActor) owns the refresh timer: **2 s while the panel is open, 15 s in the background**. Cheap readers run on the main thread; anything that talks to a kernel driver or spawns a subprocess runs in `Task.detached` and publishes back on main. Expensive readers are additionally gated: memory process list (`top`, ~0.5 s CPU) every 6 s and only while the panel is open; network info every 10 s, panel-open only.
- `MacUsageApp.swift` — AppDelegate owns an `NSStatusItem` plus a hand-rolled borderless, **non-activating** `NSPanel` instead of SwiftUI's `MenuBarExtra`. Reason: MenuBarExtra positions its window edge-aligned and can only be corrected after it's visible (flicker). The panel frame is computed centered under the icon *before* `orderFront`. Left click toggles the panel; right click builds a transient `NSMenu` (attach, `performClick`, detach — a permanent menu would swallow left clicks).
- `DetailPanelController` — second floating panel that appears beside the main one when a card is hovered, top-aligned. Dismissal is not per-view hover state: a 0.15 s timer watches the global pointer and closes only when it leaves both windows' frames (inset −8 px, 2 missed ticks). Card hover only ever *expands* (`onHover { if $0 … }`).
- Panel size changes flow through notifications: views report size via the `SizeReporter` modifier → `AppDelegate.panelContentSizeChanged` → `resizePanel` keeps the top edge pinned. `AppDelegate.panelWillHide` tells views to collapse hover state (they never get `onDisappear`; the hosting view stays alive between opens).

### Non-activating window consequences (recurring trap)

The panel never becomes the "active" window, so AppKit/SwiftUI behave unusually. Known consequences, all already worked around:
- System `Toggle`/switches render gray and inactive → hand-drawn `SettingSwitch`.
- System drag-and-drop sessions are unreliable → card reordering uses a raw `DragGesture` with visual offsets, hysteresis, and a single order commit on release.
- `.help()` tooltips are slow/flaky → charts implement custom hover (e.g. battery history).

### Data-source notes (hard-won, don't regress)

- Memory top-processes uses `top -l 1 -o mem` because its footprint metric matches Activity Monitor; `ps` rss ranks compressed-heavy processes wrong, and `proc_pid_rusage` can't see most pids without root.
- Memory pressure = 100 − sysctl `kern.memorystatus_level`. Memory breakdown "App" = internal − purgeable.
- SMC (fans + temperatures) via `SmcConnection`, no root needed; sensor keys are discovered by scanning at startup, not hard-coded (differs per Mac model). Fan keys: `F#Ac/Mn/Mx`.
- Battery history seeds 24 h from `pmset -g log` on first read (~2 s, kept off-main); live samples merge in hourly buckets.
- Battery health: System Settings' "Maximum Capacity" is powerd's model output, published in **no** public API — every registry ratio reads several points higher (Nominal/Design, Raw/Design). Read it via `system_profiler SPPowerDataType -json` (~0.2 s, cached hourly in `BatteryReader`); registry ratio is only the pre-first-fetch fallback.
- Network speed from `NET_RT_IFLIST2` 64-bit interface counters, skipping virtual interfaces (`lo/utun/awdl/llw/gif/stf/bridge/ap`).
- Wi-Fi SSID: CoreWLAN returns nil without location permission → falls back to parsing `ipconfig getsummary`.
- The public-IP lookup (api.ipify.org, 10-min cache, panel-open only) is **the app's only network request** and is disabled by the `fetchPublicIP` default. Keep it that way — README promises it.
- Launch-at-login uses `SMAppService` through `LoginItemManager`; scripts flip it by running the installed binary with `--set-login on|off` (handled at the top of `applicationDidFinishLaunching`, exits before any UI).

### Persistence

All settings are `@AppStorage` in the `com.macusage.app` defaults domain (wiped by `uninstall.sh`): `showCpuCard` … `showFansCard`, `cardOrder` (comma-separated `ExpandableSection` raw values; parser drops unknowns and appends missing so new cards appear for old installs), `fetchPublicIP`, `showsTemperatureSensorNames`.

## Subagents

`.claude/agents/macos-internals-prober.md` — before building any new stat card, delegate the "can we read X without root, and what does it cost?" question to this agent. It compiles and runs throwaway probes outside the repo and returns a verdict with the exact working API call. Don't spend main-session context spelunking IOKit/SMC/sysctl by hand; several documented APIs silently fail unprivileged, and the agent's prompt carries the list of dead ends already paid for.

## Gotchas

- Swift language mode 5: regex literals must use extended delimiters `#/…/#`, bare `/…/` does not parse.
- CPU clock speed (iStat shows it) is not readable without root on Apple Silicon — deliberately omitted.
- Fanless Macs legitimately show "No fans detected".
- Comment style is deliberate: banner comments explaining *why* at the top of each file/section, written for someone new to macOS internals. Match it.
